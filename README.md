# Student management system
 In this project I have created Complete REST APIs for student management where we can create admins, admins are able to add children and assign tasks to the children and students are able to update the status of the task .
I scheduled a cron job which be fired after each 5 minutes and if any task is overdue then it will automatically update the status of task .
